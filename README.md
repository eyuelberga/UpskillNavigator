## Configuration 

To configure Upskill Navigator for your organization, follow these steps to set up the org.config.js file, environment variables, and webhook integrations for internal resources.

### 1. Create the Configuration File

In the root of your project, locate or create the org.config.js file. This file contains all the necessary configuration options specific to your organization, including departments, roles, internal resources, and SSO integration.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to structure your org.config.js file:

```javascript

module.exports = {
  organization: {
    name: "Your Organization Name",
    departments: [
      "Department 1",
      "Department 2",
      // Add more departments here
    ],
    roles: [
      "Role 1",
      "Role 2",
      // Add more roles here
    ],
    dei_groups: [
      "Group 1",
      "Group 2",
      // Add DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) groups here
    ],
  },
  
  internalResources: {
    // Define webhook functions for internal job boards, courses, announcements, etc.
    jobBoard: {
      fetchJobs: {
        function: async () => {
          const response = await fetch(process.env.JOB_BOARD_API_URL, {
            method: "GET",
            headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}` },
          });
          return await response.json();
        },
        description: "Fetch job listings from the internal job board.",
        parameters: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            department: {
              type: "string",
              description: "Department to filter job listings (optional).",
            },
          },
        },
        returns: {
          type: "array",
          items: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              id: { type: "string", description: "Job ID" },
              title: { type: "string", description: "Job title" },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
    // Add more internal resources like courses, announcements, etc.
  },

  sso: {
    provider: "Okta", // Replace with your auth provider (e.g., Okta, Auth0, or custom)
    ssoUrl: process.env.SSO_URL,
    clientId: process.env.SSO_CLIENT_ID,
    clientSecret: process.env.SSO_CLIENT_SECRET,
    redirectUri: process.env.SSO_REDIRECT_URI,
  },

  security: {
    encryptionKey: process.env.ENCRYPTION_KEY,
    sessionTimeout: 3600, // Session timeout in seconds
  },
};
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

For security and flexibility, Upskill Navigator uses environment variables to store sensitive data like API tokens, URLs, and credentials. You can define these variables in a .env file or directly in your hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).

Add the following environment variables to your system:

```makefile

# API URLs and Tokens
JOB_BOARD_API_URL=https://api.yourcompany.com/jobs
COURSES_API_URL=https://api.yourcompany.com/courses
ANNOUNCEMENTS_API_URL=https://api.yourcompany.com/announcements
MENTORSHIP_API_URL=https://api.yourcompany.com/mentorship
API_TOKEN=your-api-token-here

# SSO Configuration
SSO_URL=https://sso.yourcompany.com
SSO_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here
SSO_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret-here
SSO_REDIRECT_URI=https://yourapp.com/auth/callback

# Security Settings
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-encryption-key-here
Note: Always store sensitive information such as API tokens, client secrets, and encryption keys in environment variables and never hard-code them into the application.
```

### 3. Webhook Integration for Internal Resources

To integrate internal resources like job boards, training courses, announcements, and mentorship opportunities, you need to define webhook functions in the internalResources section of the org.config.js file.

Each webhook function should include:

Description: A brief explanation of what the function does.

Parameters: The inputs the function accepts, defined in a JSON-schema format.

Returns: The expected output, detailing the structure of the returned data.
Hereâ€™s an example configuration for internal resource integration:

```javascript

internalResources: {
  // Job Board Integration
  jobBoard: {
    fetchJobs: {
      function: async (parameters) => {
        const response = await fetch(`${process.env.JOB_BOARD_API_URL}?department=${parameters.department}`, {
          method: "GET",
          headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}` },
        });
        return await response.json();
      },
      description: "Fetch job listings from the internal job board.",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          department: {
            type: "string",
            description: "Department to filter job listings by (optional).",
          },
        },
        required: [],
      },
      returns: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            id: { type: "string", description: "Job ID" },
            title: { type: "string", description: "Job title" },
            department: { type: "string", description: "Job department" },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  
  // Training Courses Integration
  courses: {
    fetchCourses: {
      function: async (parameters) => {
        const response = await fetch(`${process.env.COURSES_API_URL}?category=${parameters.category}`, {
          method: "GET",
          headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}` },
        });
        return await response.json();
      },
      description: "Fetch training courses from the internal training platform.",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          category: {
            type: "string",
            description: "Course category to filter by (optional).",
          },
        },
        required: [],
      },
      returns: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            id: { type: "string", description: "Course ID" },
            title: { type: "string", description: "Course title" },
            category: { type: "string", description: "Course category" },
            duration: { type: "number", description: "Course duration (in hours)" },

      },
    },
  },

    fetchAnnouncements: {
      function: async (parameters) => {
        const response = await fetch(`${process.env.ANNOUNCEMENTS_API_URL}?since=${parameters.since}`, {
          method: "GET",
          headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}` },
        });
        return await response.json();
      },
      description: "Fetch announcements from the internal communication system.",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          since: {
            type: "string",
            format: "date-time",
            description: "Fetch announcements since this date (optional).",
          },
        },
        required: [],
      },
      returns: {
        type: "array",
        items: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            id: { type: "string", description: "Announcement ID" },
            title: { type: "string", description: "Announcement title" },
            content: { type: "string", description: "Announcement content" },
            date: { type: "string", format: "date-time", description: "Date of announcement" },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },

  // Mentorship Program Integration
  mentorship: {
    fetchMentorshipMatches: {
      function: async (parameters) => {
        const response = await fetch(`${process.env.MENTORSHIP_API_URL}?department=${parameters.department}`, {
          method: "GET",
          headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_TOKEN}` },
        });
        return await response.json();
      },
      description: "Fetch potential mentorship matches from the organization.",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          department: {
            type: "string",
            description: "Department to filter mentors by (optional).",
          },

          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}

```
### 4. SSO Integration

To enable Single Sign-On (SSO) for employee authentication, configure the sso section in the org.config.js file:

```javascript

sso: {
  provider: "Your SSO Provider Name",
  ssoUrl: process.env.SSO_URL,
  clientId: process.env.SSO_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.SSO_CLIENT_SECRET,
  redirectUri: process.env.SSO_REDIRECT_URI,
}
```

Make sure the corresponding environment variables for your SSO provider are set up correctly.



## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
